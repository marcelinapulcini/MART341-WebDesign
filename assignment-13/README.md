My website will be a portfolio for myself. I already have one built at marcelinapulcini.com but I wanted to try and create one using just code vs a builder platform like WebFlow.

The goal of my website to represent myself and my skills via portfolio presentation. I would like create a simplified version of my own site that I currently have.

Responsive design is very important as it allow all users, no matter their device, to access and gather information that you have presented. Each device type has their own specific interactions and making sure that we allow for those when building a site is extremely important.
