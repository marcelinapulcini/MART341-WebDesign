    <p>
    Deemed Hunter S. Thompson's deranged and not fully accurate autobiography, <<em>Kingdom of Fear</em> is a wild romp of the misadventures of the author's crazy life and events that made him the man that he was.

    <p>
    Published in 2003, this was one of the last books published by the author before his untimely passing in 2005.
