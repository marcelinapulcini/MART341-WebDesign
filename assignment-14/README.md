How did your user testing sessions go?
My usability test went very well and I got some good feedback. Since my site is super simple, they each lasted for a total of a half hour. I found that I got some good feedback and ideas.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
The biggest changes i worked on this week was alignment of content, updating nav menu item hover, and updating the contact form to be larger and more in line with the style that I created.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
I found that I was having issues with alignment within divs and I went to CSS school and did some research to find everything that I wanted to add.
