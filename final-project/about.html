        I could write some beautiful cover letter with the right buzzwords to make all hiring managers drool. However, in all honesty, that's just not me. <b>I'm the kind of girl that would rather show my skills than talk about them. So let me keep this brief... </b>
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Through my experience as a creative designer for over 5 years, <b>I learned about my strengths in both research and design and committed to working on my weaknesses by listening and absorbing candid feedback and advice from the talented teams and managers I've worked with.</b> But the most valuable things I've learned in these last few years aren't really technical skills.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I've learned getting up from my desk and taking a walk helps creativity and ideas flow freely.
        I've learned asking for help isn't a weakness but an asset.
        I've learned taking a day to watch all of the original Star Wars films to be self-care.
        And I've learned UX design is so much more than design, it's a mindset.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <b>User Experience is about your ability to see outside your own limitations and extend your creativity into something greater.</b> When I begin a project, I always try to look outside my own personal bias and see beyond my experience to dig in and find something bigger than myself. UX allows me to get past my own roadblocks and create something truly honest and valued.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When I'm not at my computer, I'm binge watching 90s cartoons, listening to true crime podcasts, outside enjoying magnificent Montana sunsets, walking my crazy dog, or trying out new recipes.
